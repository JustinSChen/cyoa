Gophercise #3: Choose your own Adventure

This project implements a short "Choose your own Adventure" interactive style story book. It can be played by building main, and using the flag "-cli=true". 
Otherwise, it will spin up an app on localhost:8080. Navigate there to your browser to play with minimal UI.
